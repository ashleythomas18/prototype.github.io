            <p>Coal emissions are a significant contributor to air pollution and climate change. To minimize the environmental impact of coal mining and usage, several emission control strategies can be implemented:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)</h3>
            <p>CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from coal plants before they are released into the atmosphere and storing them underground in geological formations.</p>

            <h3>2. Switching to Cleaner Energy Sources</h3>
            <p>Transitioning from coal to cleaner energy sources such as natural gas, solar, and wind power can significantly reduce emissions.</p>

            <h3>3. Improving Coal Plant Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Enhancing the efficiency of coal plants can reduce the amount of coal burned for the same level of energy output, lowering emissions.</p>

            <h3>4. Implementing Pollution Control Technologies</h3>
            <p>Using technologies like scrubbers and filters can capture harmful pollutants before they are released from coal-fired power plants.</p>
