            <p>Carbon credits are a key component of emission trading programs designed to mitigate climate change. They allow organizations and individuals to offset their carbon emissions by investing in environmental projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            
            <h3>What are Carbon Credits?</h3>
            <p>A carbon credit represents one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) that has been reduced, avoided, or removed from the atmosphere. Entities that generate more CO2 than allowed can purchase carbon credits from those that emit less, creating a market-driven incentive to reduce emissions.</p>

            <h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
            <p>Carbon credits are typically issued by governments or international bodies for projects that help offset carbon emissions, such as renewable energy projects, forest conservation, and carbon capture technologies. Each credit is measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions (MTCO2e).</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Carbon Credits</h3>
            <p>Carbon credits encourage businesses to lower their emissions by creating financial value for emission reductions. They also fund crucial environmental projects globally, aiding in the fight against climate change.</p>

            <h3>Carbon Credit Markets</h3>
            <p>There are two types of carbon markets: compliance markets (where companies must comply with emission reduction targets) and voluntary markets (where organizations choose to offset their emissions). These markets help drive innovation in reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
